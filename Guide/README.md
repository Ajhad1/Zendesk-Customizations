# Zendesk-Guide-Modifications
Copies of code that can be used to modify the Zendesk Guide/Help Center

Some code segments need to be copied below or above the existing.

The code may need to be modified to identify the correct values of YOUR Guide.

Most of the code is commented out to protect against unwanted effects.
